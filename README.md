# Aggie-Piano-Keyboard
This was my first non-academic project done in Fall 2021 at the TAMU-hosted HowdyHack coding competition.

The implementation was a GUI interface that plays keys from taken directly from the piano in the MSC Banner Room at Texas A&M.
A piano very dear to all Aggies due to its place in tradition.
